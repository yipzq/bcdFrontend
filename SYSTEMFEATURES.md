## 2. Convert

There are 2 types of currencies used in our platform, USD and RMT. After users deposit USD, they can convert USD to RMT which is our platform token. This process involves minting tokens using smart contracts. RMT can also be converted into USD which involves the process of burning tokens.

## 4. Withdraw

After the recipient has received and converted the tokens back into USD, they can withdraw their money in the platform to their PayPal account by entering their email address and the amount to be withdrawn. If the email address entered has not been used to create a PayPal account before, the email sent will prompt them to register first. Withdrawal above 9,999 USD will require approval from platform admins.
